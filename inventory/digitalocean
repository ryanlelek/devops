# Here we have our provider, DigitalOcean
# The important thing is to name your provider
# and put all of your machines in that category
# to help smooth over differences from cloud to cloud
#
# It is strongly suggested to use a FQDN as a hostname
# FQDN = Fully Qualified Domain Name

# Now we specify another group called "web"
# We could have picked "www" or something else
# Group names are arbitrary, but you must be consistent
#
# We use "web" to identify all of our web servers
# This way, we'll know where to install Nginx, Apache, etc.
#
# Notice how we're reusing the above information
# simply by referencing the hostname only


[web]
raneto.yourdomain.com


# This is another group named "raneto"
# We use this group machines for our project together
# We'll utilize this group when looking to put
# project-specific files on the machines
